# Landing-Page-Foundations
First project from TOP

My first ever actual project I made from scratch. Taught me positioning and how to use semantic html elements to divide the page into different sections. Gave me some much needed flexbox practice. Too much use of padding and a lot of excess css, need to improve upon this.
